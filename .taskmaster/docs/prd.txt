# Product Requirements Document: Enhanced Alchemy Infrastructure Features

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Enhanced Alchemy Infrastructure Features for LYTX
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: July 15, 2025
**Status**: Planning

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the development of three additional infrastructure features for the LYTX analytics platform using Alchemy Infrastructure-as-Code. These features will enhance the platform's capabilities for file storage, background processing, and monitoring/analytics.

## Background & Context

LYTX currently uses Alchemy to automate the deployment of core Cloudflare resources (D1 database, KV namespaces, and Workers). To support advanced features and scalability, we need to extend the infrastructure to include:

1. **R2 Bucket Creation** - For file storage capabilities
2. **Queue Setup** - For background job processing  
3. **Analytics/Monitoring Integration** - For observability and performance tracking

These features will be integrated into the existing `alchemy.run.ts` infrastructure deployment script, maintaining the same environment-specific configuration patterns already established.

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Extend LYTX infrastructure capabilities with file storage, background processing, and monitoring
- Maintain consistency with existing Alchemy deployment patterns
- Support multi-environment deployments (dev/staging/production)
- Provide type-safe integrations with the existing codebase

### Success Metrics
- All three features successfully deploy across all environments
- Zero breaking changes to existing infrastructure deployment
- Complete TypeScript type safety for new resource bindings
- Documentation and examples for each new feature

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **LYTX Developers**: Need enhanced infrastructure capabilities for feature development
- **DevOps Engineers**: Require reliable, automated infrastructure deployment
- **Site Administrators**: Benefit from improved monitoring and file handling capabilities

### User Personas
- **Backend Developer**: Needs file storage for user uploads, exports, and backups
- **Analytics Engineer**: Requires background processing for data aggregation and reporting
- **Platform Engineer**: Needs monitoring and observability for system health

## Features & Requirements

### Feature 1: R2 Bucket Creation for File Storage

#### Description
Implement R2 bucket creation in the Alchemy deployment script to support file storage capabilities.

#### Functional Requirements
- Create environment-specific R2 buckets (with appropriate suffixes)

- Enable CORS configuration for web uploads

#### Technical Requirements
- Use Alchemy's R2Bucket resource type
- Follow existing naming conventions with environment suffixes
- Provide TypeScript bindings for worker access
- Support bucket lifecycle policies
- Enable versioning for production environments

#### Use Cases
- **User File Uploads**: Store user-uploaded analytics exports, custom dashboards
- **Static Asset Storage**: Host tracking pixel images, custom scripts
- **Backup Storage**: Store database backups and configuration exports
- **Report Generation**: Store generated PDF reports and CSV exports

### Feature 2: Queue Setup for Background Processing

#### Description
Implement Cloudflare Queue creation and configuration for background job processing.

#### Functional Requirements
- Create typed queues for different job types
- Configure producer and consumer workers
- Implement retry logic and dead letter queues
- Support batch processing for efficiency
- Enable queue monitoring and metrics

#### Technical Requirements
- Use Alchemy's Queue resource type with TypeScript generics
- Create separate queues for different job categories
- Configure appropriate batch sizes and timeouts
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Support queue scaling based on load

#### Use Cases
- **Analytics Processing**: Background aggregation of analytics data
- **Email Notifications**: Async sending of user notifications and reports
- **Data Export**: Background generation of large data exports
- **Webhook Processing**: Async processing of incoming webhook data
- **Cleanup Tasks**: Scheduled cleanup of old data and temporary files

### Feature 3: Analytics/Monitoring Integration

#### Description
Integrate monitoring and observability tools into the Alchemy infrastructure deployment.

#### Functional Requirements
- Deploy monitoring dashboards and alerting
- Configure performance tracking and metrics collection
- Set up error tracking and logging aggregation
- Enable real-time system health monitoring
- Create automated alerting for critical issues

#### Technical Requirements
- Integrate with Cloudflare Analytics Engine
- Configure custom metrics and dashboards
- Set up log aggregation and search
- Implement performance monitoring
- Create alerting rules and notification channels

#### Use Cases
- **System Health Monitoring**: Track worker performance, error rates, database health
- **User Analytics**: Monitor user engagement, feature usage, performance metrics
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Track resource usage, costs, scaling needs
- **Security Monitoring**: Detect anomalies, track access patterns, monitor threats
- **Business Intelligence**: Generate insights on platform usage and growth

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Requirements

- R2 storage should support concurrent uploads/downloads
- Monitoring should have minimal performance impact
- All resources should scale automatically with load

### Security Requirements
- Proper access controls for all new resources
- Encrypted storage for sensitive data
- Secure queue message handling
- Monitoring data privacy compliance

## Implementation Approach

3. Implement basic file upload/download functionality
4. Add environment-specific bucket policies
5. Create documentation and usage examples

### Phase 2: Queue System Implementation
1. Define queue types and message schemas
2. Add queue creation to Alchemy deployment
3. Implement producer and consumer patterns
4. Add error handling and retry logic
5. Create queue monitoring and metrics

### Phase 3: Analytics/Monitoring Integration
1. Configure Cloudflare Analytics Engine
